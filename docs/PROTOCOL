One-to-one chat:        Double ratchet algorithm between peers
Group encrypted chat:   ?
Group unencrypted chat: The list of participants should still be private and the only people able to listen in should be:
 - the participants (obviously)
 - the servers of the participants (is this necessary?)
 - ANY FUTURE PARTICIPANTS (this is really what makes it an 'unencrypted chat')
