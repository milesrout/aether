ætherwind is a simple chat protocol
æther is the name of its reference implementation

ÆTHER stands for 'Æther Thinks Humans Enjoy Replies' (hinting at the importance
of reliable replies).  It doesn't, but you may imagine that it does.

ÆTHERWIND stands for 'Ætherwind: The Highly Encrypted Remote Way (of chatting
to people) Including No (back)Doors' (no NSA-afflicted encryption protocols
used here :P).

Feel free to come up with better backcronyms.
